I am full stack Data Scientist, Machine Learning Researcher and Cloud Architect with extensive skills in four broad areas. 

- **Statistics and Machine Learning** including Model Building, Linear/Nonlinear Regression, Prediction, Hypothesis Testing, Classification, Clustering, Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, LSTM), Natural Language Processing and Data Visualization. 
- **Data Engineering** with big datasets, including relational database management, noSQL paradigms, lambda architecture, Hadoop ecosystem, Spark and data warehousing. My experience is both on cloud infrastructure~(Google Cloud Certified Professional - Data Engineer) and on-premise deployments.
- **Cloud Architecture** including design, development, provisioning and management of robust, secure, scalable, highly available, and dynamic solutions on cloud~(Google Cloud Certified Professional- Cloud Architect) with decent experience of on-premise deployments.
- **Trainings** where I've led, managed and coached machine learning teams through workshops, lectures, presentations, blogging and mentor sessions. %My area of expertise are scalable m

<!---It's a work in progress. Here is what I do know about me, but please let me know if you know more!

- Stereotypical geek; fanboy of comics, animes, mangas and fantasy novels.
- Voracious reader. Suggest me a book; I'll read it in a couple of days and start judging you for recommending it to me for the rest of our lives.
- I'm not good at dancing, but play the music and I'll dance nevertheless, unless my family members are around.
- I'd like to say swimming and horse riding - yes; I'd very much want to say that. Oh and skiing!
- I've been working in the domain of Data Science, Big Data, Machine learning and signal processing for the past six years.
- Love mathematics and teaching!-->
