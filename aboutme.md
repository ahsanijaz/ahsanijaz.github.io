## Personal

It's a work in progress. Here is what I do know about me, but please let me know if you know more!

- Stereotypical geek; fanboy of comics, animes, mangas and fantasy novels.
- Voracious reader. Suggest me a book; I'll read it in a couple of days and start judging you for recommending it to me for the rest of our lives.
- I'm not good at dancing, but play the music and I'll dance nevertheless, unless my family members are around.
- I'd like to say swimming and horse riding - yes; I'd very much want to say that. Oh and skiing!
- I've been working in the domain of Data Science, Cloud, Big Data, Machine learning and signal processing for the past eight years.
- Love mathematics and teaching
