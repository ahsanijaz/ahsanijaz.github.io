It's a work in progress. Here is what I do know about me, but please let me know if you know more!

- I look younger than I am.
- Comes in different beard sizes and mustaches.
- Weight stays at 72kg; this might sound irrelvant, but it has been constant for the past 10 years. Which, honestly, is creepy. 
- Stereotypical geek; fanboy of comics, animes, mangas and fantasy novels.
- Voracious reader. Suggest me a book; I'll read it in a couple of days and start judging you for recommending it to me for the rest of our lives.
- I'm not good at dancing, but play the music and I'll dance nevertheless, unless my family members are around.
- I'd like to say swimming and horse riding - yes; I'd very much want to say that. Oh and skiing!
- Learning to say no; not improving despite several iterations.
- Oh and I work in Data Science. It's awesome! Since all you need to do is to learn programming, statistics and machine learning. Equipped with that, you can work in any domain by working on the appropriate data set: social sciences; telecommunication; biomedical; business intelligence; financial marketing; geospatial analysis; bring it on!
