My job switched gears a year back as I joined [ADDO AI](http://addo.ai) as Chief Data Scientist and Senior Partner.  In addition to my responsibilities as a Data Scientist, my job requires writing responses of RFPs, training data science and data architecture teams, managing team and external partnerships. Unfortunately, I've been ignoring this blog for quite some time. 
I've decided to re-initiate it as I normally have strong opinions about technology. Seldom, I also have something interesting to share with the community. There has been one more change, I've started using Python as part of my machine learning pipelines over R. I've mentioned [previously](https://ahsanijaz.github.io/2015-01-04-first-post/) about my extensive use of R Markdown, nbconvert and Jekyll for blogging. So my first hurdle was setting up this blog so that it can upload both R Markdown files and jupyter notebooks as blog posts. I'll write a post soon on how that was done. 
My posts will divided under the following tags:

1. **Programming:** will discuss programming paradigms and tricks to optimize data science pipelines. 
2. **Productivity:** tags will talk about different IDEs, collaboration and management tools.
3. **Production:** where I'd discuss about production grade machine learning and watch points. 
4. **Trainings:** where I'd either share my presentations or discuss major watchpoints against each workshop. 
5. **Infrastructure** where I'd talk about the latest technology and comparisons in producing machine learning pipelines. 
6. **Data Modeling** where I'd post about data model and query design for different relational and noSQL paradigms.
