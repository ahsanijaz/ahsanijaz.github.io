I've been quite regular about blogging and opining about life, experiences and travels. Luckily for me, and the people I know, these posts have been confined to the private sphere, only accessible with my account credentials. The thought of posting about my work has crossed my mind, but it was always hampered by philosophical and psychological barriers. 
I'm finally taking the plunge of blogging in the public domain. Here, I'd post about data insights, analytics and some interesting questions answered through data sets. I'd try to keep my personal ramblings to a minimum, and even if I do digress, it would be done subtly by using an appropriate data set. In case you are reading this (HI!), do leave a comment, and feel free to contact me in case you want any kind of work done on a data set~(FREE! If the data set is interesting enough that is).
In case you are wondering about this website, it is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/); most of the posts are written in markdown and the data driven documents are generated by using [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) with Yihui's awesome R package [servr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll). I'm still looking into creating blog posts using IPython, but that is a work in progress. Generating an html is easy using [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert), but it doesn't goes well with this Jekyll theme. Oh, and a shout out to Dean Attali for his [theme](http://deanattali.com/). In addition to that, I've added a couple of plugins, [google analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)~(to know you guys) and [disqus plugin](https://disqus.com/)~(to communicate with you guys!). I'll follow up on a post with a detailed step by step procedure for setting up a website like this.
