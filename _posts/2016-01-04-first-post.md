I've been quite regular about blogging and opining about life, experiences and travels. Luckily for me, and the people I know, these posts have been confined to the private sphere, only accessible with my personal account. The thought about posting about my work has crossed my mind a few times, but it is always hampered by some philosophical and psychological blocks. I'm finally taking the plunge, and would start blogging about data insights, analytics and interesting data sets that I've come across. I'd try to keep my personal ramblings contained and not digress about topics, and even if I do, it would be done by using an appropriate data set. In case you are reading this (HI!), do leave a comment, and feel free to contact me inc case you want any kind of work done on a data set~(FREE! If the data set is interesting enough that is).
In case you are wondering about this website, it is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/); most of the posts are written in markdown and the data driven documents are generated by using [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and Yihui's awesome R package [servr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll). I'm still looking into creating blog posts using IPython, but that is a work in progress. Generating an html is easy using [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert), but it doesn't go well with this Jekyll theme. Oh, and a shout out to Dean Attali for his [theme](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert). In addition to that, I've added a couple of plugins, [google analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)~(to know you guys) and [disqus plugin](https://disqus.com/)~(to communicate with you guys!). I'll follow up on a post with a detailed step by step procedure for setting up a website like this.
